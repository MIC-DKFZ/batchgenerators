    Use this for debugging custom transforms. It does not use a background thread and you can therefore easily debug
    into your augmentations. This should not be used for training. If you want a generator that uses (a) background
    process(es), use MultiThreadedAugmenter.

        data_loader (generator or DataLoaderBase instance): Your data loader. Must have a .next() function and return
        a dict that complies with our data structure

        transform (Transform instance): Any of our transformations. If you want to use multiple transformations then
        use our Compose transform! Can be None (in that case no transform will be applied)
